Hey, I'm Hanzilka.
As I'm currently writing this I am still a student of IT High School in Czechia.
I've got some experience with frontend and backend when it comes to web and a bit of experience with C# (3 years).
To be more specific: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and like 2 minute of experience in JS.
My goal and dream is to be succesful in the IT world, I'd love to start with web dev and also make my own game/work in game dev industry.
That's all.
😐
