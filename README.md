Hey, I'm Hanzilka.
As I'm currently writing this I am still a student of IT High School in Czechia.
I've got some experience with frontend and backend when it comes to web and a bit of experience with C# (3 years), Python (Voice actor scraper done with Python).
To be more specific: HTML, CSS (and Bootstrap), PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.
My goal and dream is to be succesful in the IT world, I'd love to start with web dev and also make my own game/work in game dev industry.
That's all.
